The wordograph is a word game (in English) that allows a player to make words from a mix of random letters. 

The goal is to get as many words correctly (player words are checked against a list of words obtained from a scrabble word bank) before the time elapses.

It is a simple simple fun way to build vocabulary of the English language and also challenge yourself with each high score target.
